Mars is giant ball of dirt. Why do we go there? Because people like 
chocolate. Mitchell went there once. He got really obese from all the 
chocolate. Mitchell became so obese mars fell out of orbit and hit the 
Earth destroying all of human civilization.

Mitchell consumed them both.
Then he ate the other planets.
